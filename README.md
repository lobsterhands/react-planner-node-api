# React Planner API
## Built on Node and Express

This project is for me to learn to use MongoDB, Express, and Node to build an
API. This is my first back-end.

I began work on a front-end application (React Planner) prior to this and
realized that my mock data was lacking. So I got curious about building a
back-end.

## Development and Build Process

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `npm install` | Installs all dependencies. (Windows: may need to run 'npm install --dev' to also install dev dependencies) |
| `npm run start` | Starts development server without hot reloading. |
| `npm run dev` | Starts development server with hot reloading using nodemon. |

## Postman

If you would like to use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/ "Postman API Testing"), you can find a collection to test the endpoints and attributes that currently exist
in the /postman directory.
