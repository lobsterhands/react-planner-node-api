# React Planner API
## Built on Node and Express

This project is for me to learn to use MongoDB, Express, and Node to build an
API. This is my first back-end.

I began work on a front-end application (React Planner) prior to this and
realized that my mock data was lacking. So I got curious about building a
back-end.

## Development and Build Process
